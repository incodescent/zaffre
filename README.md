== Description ==

Thanks for trying out Zaffre, my WordPress theme!

Social Media Menu
=================
The header features an optional social media menu which is displayed on the far right of the header, and also at the bottom, above the footer, when in the portrait mode on your smart phone or tablet. To initiate it, go into "Menus" in your dashboard (under Appearance). Then Create a new menu and call it what you'd like, though I'd recommend "Social" or "Social Menu." Every link should be a Custom Link, and you just have to type or paste in the link to your Facebook, Twitter (or other) and it's set up to automatically detect which Social Media it is and replace it with the appropriate icon, i.e., if you enter in your facebook page link, you'll get a standard Facebook logo, correct color and all. Then, and this is important, under Theme Location, be sure to check the "Social" checkbox for the menu you've just created. 

I would recommend using less than 8 Social Media links, so as not to crowd the area too much.

Note, new social media will undoubtably come about in the future, in which case instead of an icon you'll get the text name of the site.
